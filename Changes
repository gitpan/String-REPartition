  No changes -- initial release

Version 1.1 : 1/12/00 01:12

  Made a few minor changes in order to fail more gracefully when presented with particularly degenerate data sets -- it's all Philip's fault.

  Fixed a somewhat stupid bug which caused gross errors when dealing with some specifically degenerate data sets.  Thanks to Mark-Jason Dominus for finding that one.
